                <h1 class="title">Who Uses Machine Learning</h1>
                <p>Most industries working with large amounts of data use machine learning to glean insights from the data to work more efficiently or gain an advantage over their competitors.</p>

                    <p class="title">Financial services</p>
                    <p>Banks and other businesses in the financial industry use machine learning technology for two key purposes: to identify important insights in data, and prevent fraud. 
                        The insights can identify investment opportunities, or help investors know when to trade. 
                        Data mining can also identify clients with high-risk profiles, or use cyber surveillance to pinpoint warning signs of fraud.</p>

                <div class="grid">
                    <p class="title">Government</p>
                    <p>Government agencies such as public safety and utilities have a particular need for machine learning since they have multiple sources of data that can be mined for insights. 
                        Analyzing sensor data, for example, identifies ways to increase efficiency and save money. 
                        Machine learning can also help detect fraud and minimize identity theft.</p>

                    <p class="title">Health care</p>
                    <p>Machine learning is a fast-growing trend in the health care industry, thanks to the advent of wearable devices and sensors that can use data to assess a patient's health in real time.
                        The technology can also help medical experts analyze data to identify trends or red flags that may lead to improved diagnoses and treatment. </p>

                    <p class="title">Marketing and sales</p>
                    <p>Websites recommending items you might like based on previous purchases are using machine learning to analyze your buying history – and promote other items you'd be interested in. 
                        This ability to capture data, analyze it and use it to personalize a shopping experience (or implement a marketing campaign) is the future of retail.</p>

                    <p class="title">Transportation</p>
                    <p>Analyzing data to identify patterns and trends is key to the transportation industry, which relies on making routes more efficient and predicting potential problems to increase profitability. 
                        The data analysis and modeling aspects of machine learning are important tools to delivery companies, public transportation and other transportation organizations.</p>
