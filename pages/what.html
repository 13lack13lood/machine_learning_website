                    <h1 class="title">What is Machine Learning?</h1>
                    <p class="what-text">Machine Learning is an application of AI(Artificial Intelligence) that gives computers or systems the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
                        In other words, its the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans. They work by using algorithms which have many different types but the fundamental goal of machine learning algorithms 
                        is to be able to predict either what something is or what is happening. It must be able to successfully interpret data that it has never 'seen' before. Like humans, there are different ways a machine 
                        can learn to perform different tasks.

                <p class="what-video-text">While artificial intelligence (AI) is the broad science of mimicking human abilities, machine learning is a specific subset of AI that trains a machine how to learn. 
                        Watch this video to better understand the relationship between AI and machine learning. You'll see the basics of how machine learning works with useful examples. <a href="reference.html#text-2">[2]</a></p>

                <h2 id="methods">Broadly, there are 3 types of Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>1. Supervised Learning</h3>
                <p>To put short, this algorithm can apply what has been learned in the past know what to do in the future. During training the algorithm compares its output with the correct output. If it gets it wrong then it modify itself in order to get it right. 
                    The algorithm should be able to know what to do for any new input after sufficient training. Examples of Supervised Learning: Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression etc.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>2. Unsupervised Learning</h3>
                <p>In this algorithm, there is no target out correct output. It is used to group similar things together or find trends. The point of this algorithm is to try to categorize data.
                    Examples of Unsupervised Learning: Apriori algorithm, K-means.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>3. Reinforcement Learning</h3>
                <p>Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions. The way it works is the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error.
                    This machine learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate decisions. Example of Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Process.
