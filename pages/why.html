                <h1 class="title">Why is Machine Learning Important</h1>
                <p>The surging interest in machine learning comes from its variety of use cases, growing volumes and varieties of available data, 
                    computational processing that is cheaper and more powerful, and affordable data storage. Machine learning is used everyday from smart assistants
                    to search recommendations to image and speech recognition.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Machine learning is a way for humans to solve problems without actually having to solve them or knowing how to solve them. 
                    Machine learning has made our lives much more easier and with self-driving cars right around the corner, machine learning will become an even bigger part of our lives.</p>

                        <h3>Smart Assistants</h3>
                        <p>Smart Assistants like Google Assistant or Siri use machine learning algorithms for speech recognition and also understanding what to do.</p>

                        <h3>Object Recognition</h3>
                        <p>Object recognition is very useful when machines need to recognize something such as different types of animals or plants or objects in general. 
                            This relies on neural networks which are a part of deep learning which is a subset of machine learning.</p>
